Y-DATA Meetup #13
MLOps: Monitoring Solutions

Second online Y-DATA meetup.
https://us02web.zoom.us/j/85344571428

Intro:
The adoption of AI in critical business operations is increasing dramatically. But together with the promise it brings to process optimization, a new type of challenge is rising regarding the “day after production”. In contrast to traditional software, AI based systems are data dependent, which makes them sensitive to drift or quality issues that might happen in production environments. As such, monitoring becomes a key element in a successful and scalable AI strategy.

In this session, we will review the specific needs that such monitoring solutions should address and how it is different from traditional IT monitoring. We will cover common monitoring paradigms and review challenges that different use cases might face. We will share and demonstrate different techniques to measure data drift and discuss the practical implications of each method.

Agenda:

Speaker: Oren Razon, co-founder and CTO of superwise.ai

18:00 - 18:45 Theory: ML Models monitoring paradigms and techniques

19:00 - 19:45 Hands-on: Data drift measurement

During fist part of the meetup we will discuss why do we need to monitor ML and how is it different from traditional monitoring. We will cover general monitoring paradigms and best practices, briefly touch special monitoring cases.
After the break we will go through notebook and review different techniques to measure data drift (multivariate and univariate metrics)
